    <h1>What is React? What are its features</h1>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Reacted was created by jordane walke
                a softwarwe engineer  at facebook in year 2011 and </li>
            <li>it was deployed first at facebook newsfeed  and later was used in facebook and instagram</li>
            <li>React is a  open source front end library </li>
            <li>It follows component base approach for building reusalble user interface components espically for single face application and it is use for developing interactive view layer of web and mobile application</li>

            <h1>Features:-</h1>
            <li>Virtual DOM</li>
            <li>One Way Data binding</li>
            <li>Resulable components</li>
            <li>JSX (javascript synte Extension)</li>
            <li>Performance</li>
        </ol> 
    


    <h1>What is Virtual DOM??</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>DOM is a document object model, created by converting HTML CSS and JS Real DOM, which is an object which gets created whenever any React application gets loaded on the screen for the first time.
        
        <li> whenever React components gets mounted on the screen for the first time. Now when any user makes any changes on the screen like button click because of which the state variable will get updated so in this case the changes will not directly go to Real DOM , instead in react we have concept known Virtual DOM.</li>
            
            So we are having two virtual doms, one virtual dom gets created at the time of mounting of react component so it is a copy of your real dom. </li>
            <li>Another virtual dom is the dom which contains the new changes, updated state variables values.</li>
        <li>Dom stands for Document object Model And it represent the state and logical structure of Document.whenever our js is loaded in browser</li>
        <li> Now these two virtual doms will get compared with each other and will check for the new changes. this complete procedure is known as diffing algorithm.</li>
        <li> Now the new changes will be updated in your Real dom. this procedure is known as Recoinciliation.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>What is library and FrameWork</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Library is set of reusable function ised by computer programs</li>
        <li>Framework is a piece of code thats dectates the architecture of project  </li>
        <li>Code will call in library but in frameWork call the code</li>
        <li>In library we can control the data flow by methods </li>
        <li>but in framework we dont have any control of the code.</li>
        <li>n library we can control the flow taht is nothing but frameWork call the code</li>
        <li>In profermance wise react is having high performance and veu and comminity supoort </li>
        <li>React is hhaving the easy learning curve and react is having SPA(Single page application)</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>What is the diff between class and functional components? why we are moving towards functional comp ?</h1>

    <ol>
        <h2>Class component</h2>
        <li>Class component usse the lifecycle method </li>
        <li>Class component are also called stateful component</li>
        <li>There is no render  </li>
        <li>In class component props and state can be accepted</li>
        <li>It is hard to read and complex strecture</li>
        <li>In class component We use "this" keyWord </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
        <li>Functionsl component we use Hoocks </li>
        <li>Functional component are also called state less component</li>
        <li>In function there is return</li>
        <li>Functional Component is a plan javascript it doesn't have choice</li>
        <li>Functional component only accepts props as an argument </li>
        <li>It is easy to read</li>
        <li>We dont need Keywods</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>State ful and state less</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>If it is using state it is stateful component </li>
        <li>it can hold and can manage the state</li>
        <li>It is complex as compare to stateless component</li>
        <li>It can work with lifecycle it can use any usestate HOOKS</li>
        <li>It can be reuse</li>
        <li>It is class component</li>

        <h2>StateLess</h2>
        
        <li>If not using state it is state less component</li>
        <li>It doesn't hold any manage state</li>
        <li>it is simple and easy to understand</li>
        <li>Propes Is done </li>
        <li>It does not work with any reaact lifecycle</li>
        <li>It cannot be reuse</li>
        <li>It is also known as functional component</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
        What are the different phases of React componentâ€™s lifecycle?
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Initial phase</li>
        <li>Mounting</li>
        <li>Unmounting</li>
        <li>Updating Phase</li>
    
    </ol>
